I'm Dat.
I was a thermal engineer in the space industry for the past 5+ years.
I've worked on some very cool satellites and payloads, but over time, I discovered a passion for data analysis and programming.
So I decided to switch careers and pursue data analytics.

I'm most experienced programming with Python, but recently I've been diving into R for statistical computing and SQL for querying databases.
I consider myself passionate about data visualizaiton and I really enjoy the challenge of creating visuals that are effective and easily understood.
Though I've used Excel or packages like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create charts, I'm gaining proficiency with dedicated tools like Tableau.
And in my free time, I have too many hobbies to keep track of...my latest obsessions are brainstorming cross-cultural food dishes and learning to read/speak Japanese.

Here you can check out my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/docs/Resume_DatLe.pdf) or data analysis [portfolio]({% link _pages/portfolio.md %}). 
Occasionally I'll [blog]({% link _pages/blog-year.md %}) about data analysis, data science, programming, or related topics.
